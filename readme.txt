== Description ==
= Overview =

*   The **Easy PayPal Digital Downloads** WordPress Plugin makes it easy to turn your WordPress site into an eCommmerce website and start selling digital products.

*	Simply install the plugin, enter your PayPal business information on the settings page, and use the automatic button inserter to place Buy Now buttons on your site.

*   Easy PayPal Digital Downloads works with any WordPress theme.

*   This plugin is developed by an Official PayPal Partner.

If you are selling digital goods, this plugin is a must because it keeps customers on your website by opening a popup window where they can pay.
This reduces the likelihood of customers leaving during checkout. Unlike most PayPal website integerations that keep customers on your site, no security certificate (SSL) is required.

What makes this plugin different then others on the WordPress Repository is the level of security built into how the digital files are handled. 
Other plugins render the items URL on the webpage by using MD5 encryption. However the MD5 URL can be easily broken allowing anyone to get your item for free.

What this plugin does is creates a unique hexidecimal string at install. Then in combination with MD5 encrypts your digital products URL into a string capable of being decoded only by your website. This is medical grade encryption and makes obtaining the download URL nearly impossible.

*	Built in support for 18 languages
